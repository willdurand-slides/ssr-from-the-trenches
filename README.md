# Server Side Rendering from the trenches

## Abstract

Server Side Rendering (SSR) is a technique to reuse client-side JavaScript code
on the server. The main advantage is to speed up the first rendering time and
improve the user experience on page load. It is considered one of the most
complicated features to implement in the JS ecosystem. Yet, web apps with a high
traffic often need it. In this talk, Iâ€™ll start by introducing the concept of
SSR, followed by examples with React, Vue and some other frameworks (like Next
or Nuxt). The last part will be dedicated to what I've learned building the new
Mozilla Add-ons frontend.
